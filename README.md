# claude-deep-review

A comprehensive, research-backed code review skill for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) that orchestrates parallel concern-specialized agents, cross-validates findings with deterministic verification, and produces unified review reports.

## What it does

Deep Review dispatches 5-7 specialized agents in parallel, each examining your code changes through a different lens:

| Agent | Optimized | Frontier | Focus |
|-------|-----------|----------|-------|
| **bug-detector** | Sonnet | Opus | Logic errors, edge cases, error handling, resource leaks |
| **security-reviewer** | **Opus** | **Opus** | OWASP top 10, injection, auth, SSRF, deserialization |
| **cross-file-impact-analyzer** | Sonnet | Opus | How changes affect callers and dependents across the codebase |
| **test-analyzer** | Sonnet | Opus | Test coverage gaps, test quality, missing edge cases |
| **conventions-and-intent** | Sonnet | Opus | CLAUDE.md compliance, spec alignment, comment accuracy |
| **type-design-analyzer** | Sonnet | Opus | Type encapsulation and invariant design (conditional) |
| **code-simplifier** | Sonnet | Opus | Simplification opportunities (post-review, conditional) |

Two review modes are available. **Optimized** (default) is ~40% cheaper and faster — Sonnet for most agents, Opus only for security. **Frontier** uses Opus for all agents. Security always gets Opus in both modes because different models have complementary vulnerability-class detection profiles.

After agents report findings, a validation pipeline filters false positives:

1. **Git blame classification** — labels each finding as "new" (introduced by this PR) or "surfaced" (pre-existing code exposed by this change)
2. **Deterministic verification** — confirms findings reference real code at correct locations
3. **LLM judgment** — attempts to disprove each finding with a calibrated confidence rubric
4. **Dimension-specific thresholds** — security uses 70 (false negatives are costly), others use 80
5. **Blind challenge round** — fresh agents attempt to disprove blocking findings
6. **Contradiction resolution** — specs suppress bug findings, security wins ties
7. **Max findings cap** — configurable limit prevents noise in high-debt codebases

## Key features

- **Concern-parallel, not file-parallel** — each agent sees the full diff with cross-file context, because bugs at module boundaries are invisible to file-scoped reviewers
- **Full-codebase investigation** — security and cross-file-impact agents trace data flows beyond the diff into the entire repository (matching [Anthropic's own approach](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/code-review))
- **New vs surfaced findings** — git blame classifies whether each finding is new code you wrote or pre-existing code exposed by your changes. Surfaced findings are downgraded and grouped separately so they don't drown out real issues
- **Incremental review** — when re-reviewing a PR with new commits, offers to review only the changes since the last review instead of starting from scratch
- **Prompt injection defense** — code under review is untrusted input, wrapped in trust boundary delimiters with output scanning for injection artifacts
- **Context-pulling** — agents actively investigate using Read/Grep/LSP rather than receiving a passive context dump (51% fewer false positives per research)
- **GitHub + GitLab** — auto-detects platform from git remote, supports both `gh` and `glab` CLIs
- **REVIEW.md configuration** — hierarchical config mirroring CLAUDE.md locations. The skill scaffolds REVIEW.md files for you and maintains the ignore list as you dismiss findings
- **Flexible delivery** — PR/MR comments, markdown file, chat, task board, or any combination
- **Task board integration** — create tasks from findings with user-controlled selection ("all", "1,3,5", "all critical and high", "all except 6")
- **Graceful degradation** — if an agent fails, the review continues with remaining agents and notes the gap

## Installation

Add the marketplace and install the plugin:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add https://github.com/liatrio-labs/claude-deep-review.git
claude plugin install claude-deep-review@claude-deep-review
```

To update later:

```bash
claude plugin update claude-deep-review@claude-deep-review
```

## Usage

The skill triggers automatically when you ask for a code review in Claude Code:

```
# Review a PR (GitHub)
deep review PR #42

# Review a merge request (GitLab)
review MR !89 thoroughly

# Review local uncommitted changes
comprehensive review of my changes

# Focused review
deep review PR #42, focus only on security and error handling
```

Or invoke it directly:

```
/deep-review
```

## How it works

The review runs through 7 phases:

0. **Pre-flight** — checks if the PR/MR is eligible (not closed, draft, or already reviewed). For previously reviewed PRs, offers incremental review of new commits only
1. **Target** — detects GitHub/GitLab from git remote, fetches PR/MR metadata and diff
2. **Triage** — classifies files by risk, detects AI-generated code (elevated risk), discovers related tests, gathers CLAUDE.md + REVIEW.md context, runs git blame preprocessing, produces a change summary. For PRs over 500 lines, generates per-file summaries
3. **Dispatch** — launches 5-7 agents in parallel with scoped context, trust boundary delimiters, and context-pulling instructions
4. **Validate** — git blame classification (new vs surfaced), deterministic verification, confidence filtering, injection artifact scanning, challenge round, contradiction resolution, deduplication, max findings cap
5. **Report** — generates a structured report with severity-ranked findings, surfaced findings section, GitHub/GitLab permalinks, and a methodology section documenting what ran
6. **Deliver** — asks how you want results: PR/MR comments, markdown file, chat, task board, or all. Offers to add dismissed findings to REVIEW.md for future suppression

## REVIEW.md configuration

Deep Review will offer to scaffold a `REVIEW.md` when it doesn't find one. The file mirrors your CLAUDE.md locations — if you have subdirectory CLAUDE.md files, the skill offers to create matching REVIEW.md files at the same levels.

**Root REVIEW.md** sets global defaults. **Subdirectory REVIEW.md** files can set different standards per area (e.g., stricter security for `src/auth/`). Settings (thresholds) override from child to parent; rules and ignore patterns accumulate.

```markdown
## Rules
- All database queries must use parameterized statements
- Public API endpoints must validate request body schema

## Ignore
# Suppress known findings. Deep Review suggests additions when you dismiss findings.
- security:"prompt injection via template tokens" (not exploitable in current architecture, 2026-03-24)

## Skip
- "vendor/**"
- "**/*.generated.cs"

## Confidence Threshold
# Default: 80. Security always uses minimum 70 regardless of this setting.
80

## Max Findings
# Cap findings in high-debt codebases. Default: no limit.
15
```

## Research backing

Every architectural decision is grounded in published research:

| Decision | Research basis |
|----------|---------------|
| 5-7 agents | Quality plateaus at 4-6 agents (DeepMind 2025); unstructured parallel systems amplify errors 17.2x |
| Concern decomposition | Anthropic, Ellipsis, Qodo all use concern-parallel, not file-parallel |
| Deterministic verification | LLM-on-LLM verification shares correlated errors ~60% of the time; deterministic grounding is essential |
| Context-pulling | cubic achieved 51% fewer false positives switching from push to pull |
| Security threshold 70 | Anthropic's own judge filtered 7/8 security findings at threshold 80, including real ones |
| Overconfidence calibration | Xiong et al. (ICLR 2024): LLMs cluster confidence in 80-100 range |
| Full-codebase security | Cat Wu (Anthropic): "agents often take the entire codebase into account" |
| Prompt injection defense | Every major AI review tool has been exploited; 5-layer defense recommended |
| LSP-first navigation | 900x faster than grep (50ms vs 30-60s); eliminates false matches |
| AI-code risk elevation | CodeRabbit: 75% more logic errors in AI-authored code |
| 500-line large-PR threshold | Review effectiveness drops sharply above 400 lines |
| Git blame classification | SonarQube's baseline matching is the gold standard; blame-based new/surfaced is the best approach for AI-native tools |
| Suggest-not-modify config | Google SRE Workbook: tools should suggest config changes through reviewable mechanisms, not modify automatically |
| REVIEW.md hierarchy | Nearest-only with explicit inheritance (Ruff, Biome v2) after ESLint's painful cascading lessons |
| Max findings cap | Qodo defaults to 3 findings per review; configurable cap prevents noise in high-debt repos |
