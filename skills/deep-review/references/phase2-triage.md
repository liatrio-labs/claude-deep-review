## 2a. Detect VCS Platform

Auto-detect from `git remote get-url origin`:
- GitHub → `gh` CLI, "PR"
- GitLab (including self-hosted) → `glab` CLI, "MR"

If detection fails, ask the user.

---

## 2b. Ensure Working Tree Reflects Review Target

Before running any diff commands, confirm the local working tree matches the review target. Use the `pr_number` resolved in Phase 1 — never extract PR numbers from branch names (branch names may contain upstream PR numbers that differ from the PR number in the current repo).

**1. Resolve the target's head SHA:**
- **PR/MR mode (`pr_number` set):** `gh pr view {pr_number} --json headRefOid --jq '.headRefOid'` (GitHub) / `glab mr view {pr_number} --output json | jq '.sha'` (GitLab)
- **Branch comparison:** `git rev-parse <branch>`
- **Local changes:** HEAD — no-op, already on correct state

**2. Compare against current HEAD:**
```
git rev-parse HEAD
```
If the SHA matches → proceed to 2c.

**3. If mismatch → checkout:**
| Target type | Command |
|---|---|
| PR/MR number or URL | `gh pr checkout <number>` (GitHub) / `glab mr checkout <number>` (GitLab) |
| Branch name | `git checkout <branch>` |
| Local changes | no-op |

**4. If checkout fails → STOP immediately:**
```
Unable to checkout [branch/PR]. The review requires the target code to be accessible locally.
You can checkout the branch manually and re-run the review.
```
No fallback or workaround — a silently wrong working tree produces unreliable review results.

---

## 2c. Identify Review Target

Use `target_type` and `pr_number` from Phase 1's "Resolve review target" step. Do not re-derive the PR number here.

1. **PR/MR mode** (`pr_number` set) — Use `gh pr view {pr_number}`/`glab mr view {pr_number}` + diff commands. Get full SHA: `git rev-parse HEAD`
   - **GitHub (PR):** Gather the file list with `gh pr diff {pr_number} --name-only`. Gather the full diff with `gh pr diff {pr_number}`.
   - **GitLab (MR):** Gather the file list with `glab mr diff {pr_number} --name-only`. Gather the full diff with `glab mr diff {pr_number}`.
2. **Branch comparison** — `git diff <base>...HEAD` and `git diff --name-only <base>...HEAD`
3. **Local changes** — `git diff HEAD` (or `git diff --cached` if nothing unstaged)

**Save the diff for Phase 4 (PR/MR mode only):** After collecting the full diff in PR/MR mode, save it to `$TMPDIR/deep-review-diff-{head_sha_short}.patch` for use by `verify_findings.py` via `--diff-file`. The `gh pr diff` / `glab mr diff` output is server-computed and fork-safe, avoiding local merge-base failures that can occur with `git diff`.

```bash
# Save the PR diff to a file (only in PR/MR mode)
gh pr diff {pr_number} > "$TMPDIR/deep-review-diff-{head_sha_short}.patch"
```

Validate the saved diff before relying on it:
- Non-empty (file size > 0)
- Starts with `diff --git` (confirms it is a valid unified diff, not an error message)

If `gh pr diff` fails (e.g., 20K-line / 300-file API limit exceeded), omit `--diff-file` in Phase 4 and let `verify_findings.py` use its own git diff fallback chain. For **branch comparison** and **local changes** target types, do not save a diff file — `verify_findings.py` will compute the diff locally.

Check for `docs/`, `specs/`, `research/` directories and `REVIEW.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `QODO.md` at repo root and in directories with changed files.

---

## 2d. Gather Project Context

1. **CLAUDE.md** — Read from repo root and directories with changed files.
2. **REVIEW.md** — Discover hierarchically. See `references/review-md-spec.md` for format, scaffolding templates, and hierarchy rules. REVIEW.md lets maintainers customize focus areas, skip patterns, custom rules, thresholds, and ignore patterns.
3. **AGENTS.md / QODO.md** — Read if present.

**Tool instructions for file discovery:**

Use **Glob** to find all CLAUDE.md, REVIEW.md, AGENTS.md, and QODO.md files:
```
Glob(pattern: "**/CLAUDE.md")
Glob(pattern: "**/REVIEW.md")
Glob(pattern: "**/AGENTS.md")
Glob(pattern: "**/QODO.md")
```

Never use `find` from Bash for locating these files.

### REVIEW.md Detection

Complete this check before proceeding to 2e. REVIEW.md settings cascade to all thresholds, rules, and ignore patterns for the entire review.

Find all CLAUDE.md locations, check each for a matching REVIEW.md:

- **No REVIEW.md anywhere:**
  ```
  No REVIEW.md found. For a guided setup, run build-review-md first, then restart the review. Or continue without one.
  ```

- **Root exists but subdirectory CLAUDE.md has no matching REVIEW.md:**
  ```
  AskUserQuestion(
    questions: [{
      question: "Found REVIEW.md at repo root, but {directory} has a CLAUDE.md without a matching REVIEW.md. A subdirectory REVIEW.md lets you set different review standards for this area. Create one?",
      header: "Subdirectory REVIEW.md",
      multiSelect: false,
      options: [
        { label: "Yes — create it", description: "Inherits root settings, adds directory-specific rules" },
        { label: "Not now — root config applies", description: "Use root REVIEW.md settings for all directories" }
      ]
    }]
  )
  ```

- **All locations covered** → proceed.

See `references/review-md-spec.md` section Discovery for the full prompts and scaffolding templates. Merge configs hierarchically: settings override, rules and patterns accumulate.

## 2e. Classify Changed Files by Risk Level

- **High risk** — auth, security, payment, data access, public APIs, DB migrations, crypto, infra/deploy, permission/RBAC. Also >200 lines changed. Also: files implementing a cache, proxy, decorator, or delegation pattern (caching proxies are a common source of recursive delegation and stale-data bugs — flag these even if the diff appears mechanical).
- **Medium risk** — business logic, services, controllers, middleware, state management. 50-200 lines changed.
- **Low risk** — tests, docs, config, generated code, lockfiles, formatting-only. <50 lines changed.

High-risk files get expanded context (callers, callees, related tests); low-risk get lighter review.

**Content-change promotion.** After initial classification, check LOW-risk files for substantive content changes — any diff line that changes a string value, numeric value, or identifier (not just formatting, whitespace, markup, or delimiters). Files with substantive content changes get promoted to MEDIUM. This is type-agnostic.

Promotion triggers: i18n text changes, config value changes, CSS/SCSS numeric changes, changed string literals or identifiers.
Stay LOW: lock files, whitespace-only changes, generated code updates, tag case changes (`<br/>` → `<br />`).

### Light Review for Trivial PRs

If ALL files are low-risk AND total lines <50, ask Light review vs Full review (template in `references/phase1-preflight.md`). Skipped when REVIEW.md sets `focus`. In light mode, triage announcement shows `Review dimensions: bugs, security (light review mode)`.

---

## 2f. Change Summarizer

> A subagent produces a cleaner summary than the orchestrator can at this point — your growing context biases any summary you produce. Dispatching a fresh agent avoids contaminating the summary that all review agents will rely on.

> **Dispatch ordering:** 2f is independent of 2e (risk classification). Dispatch the change summarizer concurrent with 2e — launch both in the same message for parallel execution. The summarizer result is needed by Phase 3 agents, so earlier dispatch reduces latency.

> **CRITICAL RULE: Agent calls (2f and 2j) must be dispatched in their own parallel group — NEVER bundle with Bash/Glob/Grep commands (2g, 2h, 2i).** When a Bash command in a parallel batch errors, Claude Code cancels co-dispatched Agent calls, forcing expensive re-dispatch. Separate Agent dispatch from file discovery/Bash operations.

Dispatch a **Sonnet agent** for a 3-5 sentence semantic summary describing what the PR *claims* to do, why, and the risk profile. Provided to ALL review agents as shared context.

In **Frontier mode**, use an **Opus agent** instead of Sonnet for the summarizer to leverage extended reasoning capabilities.

**Critical framing rule:** Frame all statements as claims: "The PR claims to reorganize X by extracting from A into B." Never use "clean", "correct", "safe", "straightforward", "simple", "trivial", or "verbatim" — these pre-judge quality. The summary must never conclude that a refactoring is correct.

**Agent tool call template:**
```
Agent(
  subagent_type: "deep-review:change-summarizer",
  description: "Change summarizer",
  prompt: "PR title: {title}
    PR description: {body}
    Diff:
    <untrusted-code-content>
    {paste full diff}
    </untrusted-code-content>"
)
```

After dispatch, announce: "Dispatched 1 agent for Phase 2f."

**Large PR note:** If the PR exceeds 500 lines, also dispatch 2j file-level summarization agents. Launch 2f and 2j agents in the same message for parallel execution — but in a SEPARATE parallel message from Bash/Glob/Grep operations (2g, 2h, 2i). This prevents Agent cancellation on Bash errors.

---

## 2g. Related Test Discovery

For each changed production file, find test files by convention (`Tests`, `.test`, `.spec`, `_test`, `_spec` patterns; `tests/`, `__tests__/`, `spec/` directories). Include in context for bug-detector and test-analyzer.

**Tool instructions:**

Use **Glob** to find test files. Pattern examples:
- `**/*.test.js`, `**/*.test.ts` (Jest/Vitest style)
- `**/*.spec.js`, `**/*.spec.ts` (Jasmine/Mocha style)
- `**/tests/**/*.py`, `**/__tests__/**/*.py` (Python)
- `**/*_test.go`, `**/*_test.rs` (Go/Rust)

Example:
```
Glob(pattern: "**/*.test.{js,ts,py}")
Glob(pattern: "**/__tests__/**/*")
Glob(pattern: "**/tests/**/*")
```

Never use `find` or `grep` from Bash for test discovery.

---

## 2h. Docs/Specs Context

If `docs/`, `specs/`, `research/` exist, read relevant files. Send only to conventions-and-intent agent and Phase 8 report generation — NOT all agents (avoids biasing toward confirming intent rather than finding bugs).

**Tool instructions for file discovery:**

Use **Glob** to find documentation and specification files:
```
Glob(pattern: "docs/**/*.md")
Glob(pattern: "specs/**/*.md")
Glob(pattern: "research/**/*.md")
```

Then use **Read** to load relevant files for each changed file's directory. Never use `find` from Bash for locating docs/specs.

---

## 2i. History Context Preprocessing

**Deterministic preprocessing, not an LLM agent.** For each changed file:
1. `git log --oneline --max-count=50 -- <file>` for recent change history
2. `git blame` on changed line ranges (used by verify_findings.py in Phase 4)

Distribute: bug-detector gets history context; conventions-and-intent gets pattern drift context.

---

## 2j. File-Level Summarization (PRs > 500 Lines)

Dispatch parallel **Sonnet agents** (one per file) for 2-3 sentence summaries. For large PRs, launch 2f and 2j agents **in the same message with multiple Agent tool calls** for true parallel execution. Concatenate into a summary-of-summaries for architectural awareness.

**Agent tool call template (repeat per changed file):**
```
Agent(
  subagent_type: "deep-review:change-summarizer",
  description: "Summarize {filename}",
  prompt: "File: {filename}
    Mode: per-file summary (2-3 sentences)
    Diff:
    <untrusted-code-content>
    {file-scoped diff}
    </untrusted-code-content>"
)
```

After dispatch, announce: "Dispatched N agents for Phase 2j."

**IMPORTANT:** 2f and 2j Agent dispatch must be in a SEPARATE parallel message from 2g/2h/2i operations. Dispatch 2f+2j agents in one parallel batch, then in a NEW message dispatch 2g (test discovery), 2h (docs/specs), and 2i (history context) Bash/Glob/Grep operations. This prevents Agent calls from being cancelled if a Bash command fails.

---

## 2k. AI-Generated Code Detection

Scan for AI co-author trailers, attribution comments, AI tool metadata. **Elevate AI-generated files one risk level** (research shows 75% more logic errors in AI-authored code). Include AI-generation status in risk classification sent to all agents.

**Tool instructions:**

Use **Grep** to search for AI co-author indicators in changed files:
- Git trailers: `Co-Authored-By`, `Co-authored-by`, `Copilot-By`
- Comments: patterns like `AI-generated`, `generated by`, `GPT`, `Claude`, `Copilot`, `ChatGPT`
- Metadata: language-specific markers (e.g., `<!-- AI generated -->`, `# AI generated`)

Example:
```
Grep(pattern: "Co-[Aa]uthored-[Bb]y|Copilot-By", type: "text", glob: "**/*.py")
Grep(pattern: "AI-generated|generated by (GPT|Claude|Copilot|ChatGPT)", glob: "**/*.{js,ts,py}")
Grep(pattern: "<!-- AI|# AI generated|// AI generated", glob: "**/*.{js,ts,py,md,html}")
```

Never use `grep` or `find` from Bash for AI detection.

---

## 2l. Determine Review Dimensions

All on by default unless REVIEW.md disables them. In **Optimized** mode, all agents use Sonnet except security-reviewer (always Opus). In **Frontier** mode, all agents use Opus.

Skip conditions: test-analyzer (no test files in repo), type-design-analyzer (no new types).

---

## Phase 2 Parallel Execution Strategy

To maximize throughput while maintaining robustness, Phase 2 is divided into TWO sequential parallel batches:

**BATCH 1 (Agent Dispatch):** Dispatch 2f (change summarizer) and 2j (file-level summaries, if PR > 500 lines) in a single message with multiple Agent tool calls. These are expensive operations and should run as early as possible.

```
Agent(subagent_type: "deep-review:change-summarizer", ...)
Agent(subagent_type: "deep-review:change-summarizer", ...)  # 2j, if needed
```

Wait for agents to complete.

**BATCH 2 (File Discovery & History):** In a NEW message, execute 2e (risk classification), 2g (test discovery), 2h (docs/specs reading), and 2i (git history) as Bash/Glob/Grep operations. These are lightweight and low-risk for failure.

```
Glob(...) # test file discovery
Read(...) # docs/specs reading
Bash("git log ...") # history context
```

**Why separate?** When a Bash command fails in a parallel batch, Claude Code cancels all co-dispatched calls, including expensive Agent operations. Separating Agent dispatch (BATCH 1) from Bash operations (BATCH 2) ensures Agent work is not wasted on Bash failures. (Note: This two-batch strategy is a workaround for current Claude Code cancellation behavior. Re-evaluate if this platform behavior changes.)

---

## Triage Announcement

Announce triage results before proceeding: PR title, review mode, file counts by risk level, AI-generated files if any, active dimensions. For 1000+ line PRs, add: "This PR is [N] lines. Review effectiveness drops sharply above 400 lines. Consider splitting into smaller PRs."
