## LSP-first investigation

Use LSP as the primary tool for semantic code navigation. LSP provides accurate symbol resolution (~50ms) that catches renamed imports, aliased references, and interface implementations that text-based search misses.

**Primary operations (use first):**

- `goToDefinition` -- trace what a symbol actually resolves to across files and inheritance chains
- `findReferences` -- locate every caller, consumer, or implementor of a symbol across the codebase
- `hover` -- inspect inferred types and signatures without reading entire files

**Fallback (when LSP is unavailable):**

- `Grep` -- text-based search for symbol names, patterns, and string literals
- `Glob` -- find files by name or path pattern
- `Read` -- load file contents for surrounding context and full function bodies

**When to use each:**

- LSP for symbol resolution, type checking, and reference finding (semantic accuracy)
- Grep for text patterns, string literals, config values, and comments (LSP does not index these)
- Read for understanding surrounding context, control flow, and full function bodies
