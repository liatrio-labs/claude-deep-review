# Deep Review Report Format

Use this template for the unified review report. Adapt section headers based on what was actually found — don't include empty sections.

## GitHub Permalink Format

All code references in findings MUST use platform-appropriate permalinks so they remain stable:

**GitHub:**
```
https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/blob/{full_sha}/{path}#L{start}-L{end}
```

**GitLab:**
```
https://gitlab.com/{group}/{project}/-/blob/{full_sha}/{path}#L{start}-L{end}
```

For self-hosted instances, replace the hostname with the one detected from the git remote URL. See SKILL.md Phase 1a for VCS detection and Phase 5 for permalink format details.

**Rules:**
- MUST use the full 40-character SHA, never an abbreviated hash. If you only have a ref (branch name, short SHA, `HEAD`), resolve it first: `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits/{ref} --jq .sha`
- MUST include at least 1 line of context before and after the relevant line. For example, if the issue is on line 5, link to `#L4-L6`. If the issue spans lines 10-15, link to `#L9-L16`.
- For single-line issues, still use the range format with context (e.g., `#L4-L6`).

## Full Report Template

```markdown
# Deep Review: {title}

**Date:** {date}
**Scope:** {PR #N | Branch comparison: base...head | Local changes}
**Files reviewed:** {N} ({high_risk} high-risk, {med_risk} medium, {low_risk} low)
**Lines changed:** +{additions} / -{deletions}
**Dimensions checked:** {comma-separated list of dimensions that ran}

---

## Change Summary

{A brief, structured overview of what this change does. This section helps readers quickly understand the scope before diving into findings.}

- **What changed:** {1-2 sentences describing the functional change}
- **Key files:** {list the 3-5 most important files changed, with one-line descriptions}
- **Patterns observed:** {e.g., "New API endpoints added", "Refactor of auth module", "Database migration + model update"}

---

## Executive Summary

{2-3 sentences: what was reviewed, key finding themes, overall assessment.
Example: "This PR adds JWT-based authentication to the API layer. The implementation is solid overall, but the token validation has a critical bypass path and the error handling in the auth middleware silently swallows connection failures. 3 findings require attention before merge."}

### Verdict

{One of: APPROVE — no blocking issues | APPROVE WITH SUGGESTIONS — non-blocking improvements | REQUEST CHANGES — blocking issues found}

**Blocking issues:** {N}
**Non-blocking issues:** {N}
**Suggestions:** {N}

---

## Critical Issues

{These MUST be fixed before merge. Include only findings with severity=critical and confidence>=80.}

### {finding.id}: {finding.title}

**File:** `{finding.file}:{finding.line_start}` | [permalink](https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/blob/{full_sha}/{finding.file}#L{line_start-1}-L{line_end+1})
**Dimension:** {finding.dimension} | **Confidence:** {finding.confidence}%
**Flagged by:** {list of agents that found this}

{finding.description}

**Evidence:**
```
{finding.evidence — the actual code snippet or behavior demonstrating the issue}
```

**Suggested fix:**
{finding.suggestion}

---

## High-Priority Issues

{Should be fixed. Same format as Critical, but with severity=high.}

---

## Medium Issues

{Worth addressing. Briefer format:}

| # | File | Issue | Dimension | Confidence |
|---|------|-------|-----------|------------|
| {id} | [`{file}:{line}`](https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/blob/{full_sha}/{file}#L{line-1}-L{line+1}) | {title} | {dimension} | {confidence}% |

{For each, a brief 1-2 sentence description below the table, or expand inline if the issue is nuanced.}

---

## Low-Priority Suggestions

{Nice to have. Bullet list format:}

- **{id}**: [`{file}:{line}`](https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/blob/{full_sha}/{file}#L{line-1}-L{line+1}) — {title} ({dimension}, {confidence}%)

---

## Positive Observations

{What the code does well. This section matters — it signals what patterns to keep and provides balanced feedback. 3-5 bullet points.}

- {Positive observation with specific example}

---

## Review Dimensions Summary

{Brief per-dimension summary showing what each agent found or confirmed was clean.}

| Dimension | Agent | Findings | Notes |
|-----------|-------|----------|-------|
| Correctness & Error Handling | bug-detector | {N issues} | {summary or "Clean"} |
| Security | security-reviewer | {N issues} | {summary} |
| Cross-file Impact | cross-file-impact-analyzer | {N issues} | {summary} |
| Test Coverage | test-analyzer | {N issues} | {summary} |
| Conventions & Intent | conventions-and-intent | {N issues} | {summary} |
| Type Design | type-design-analyzer | {N issues or "Skipped"} | {summary} |
| Code Simplification | code-simplifier | {N issues or "Skipped"} | {summary} |

## Review Methodology

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Agents dispatched** | {list each agent with completion status: completed/failed/skipped} |
| **Model tier** | {Opus: bug-detector, security-reviewer, cross-file-impact-analyzer; Sonnet: test-analyzer, conventions-and-intent, validators} |
| **Findings pipeline** | {N raw findings → M after deterministic verification → K after confidence filter → J after dedup} |
| **Challenge round** | {Triggered/Not triggered (requires 3+ blocking findings). If triggered: N findings challenged, M downgraded} |
| **Contradictions resolved** | {N contradictions between agents, resolution summary} |
| **Failed/skipped agents** | {list or "none"} |
| **Total review time** | {duration from Phase 0 to Phase 5} |
| **Prompt injection** | {N injection artifacts detected and discarded, or "none detected"} |
```

## PR Comment Format (abbreviated)

When posting as a PR comment, use this shorter format:

```markdown
### Deep Review

**Verdict:** {APPROVE | APPROVE WITH SUGGESTIONS | REQUEST CHANGES}

   {1-2 sentence description}

{If medium/low exist:}
<details>
<summary>{N} additional suggestions</summary>

{bullet list of medium/low issues, each with permalink}
