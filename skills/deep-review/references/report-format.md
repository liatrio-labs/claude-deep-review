# Deep Review Report Format

Use this template for the unified review report. Adapt section headers based on what was actually found — don't include empty sections.

**Emoji format:** Always use Unicode emoji characters (🔴 🟠 🟡 💡), never GitHub shortcodes (`:red_circle:`, `:orange_circle:`). Shortcodes don't render in terminal/chat output.

## GitHub Permalink Format

All code references in findings MUST use platform-appropriate permalinks so they remain stable:

**GitHub:**
```
https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/blob/{full_sha}/{path}#L{start}-L{end}
```

**GitLab:**
```
https://gitlab.com/{group}/{project}/-/blob/{full_sha}/{path}#L{start}-L{end}
```

For self-hosted instances, replace the hostname with the one detected from the git remote URL. See SKILL.md Phase 2a for VCS detection and Phase 6 for permalink format details.

**Rules:**
- MUST use the full 40-character SHA, never an abbreviated hash. If you only have a ref (branch name, short SHA, `HEAD`), resolve it first: `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits/{ref} --jq .sha`
- MUST include at least 1 line of context before and after the relevant line. For example, if the issue is on line 5, link to `#L4-L6`. If the issue spans lines 10-15, link to `#L9-L16`.
- For single-line issues, still use the range format with context (e.g., `#L4-L6`).

## Full Report Template

```markdown
# Deep Review: {title}

**Date:** {date}
**Scope:** {PR #N | Branch comparison: base...head | Local changes}
**Files reviewed:** {N} ({high_risk} high-risk, {med_risk} medium, {low_risk} low)
**Lines changed:** +{additions} / -{deletions}
**Dimensions checked:** {comma-separated list of dimensions that ran}

---

## Change Summary

{A brief, structured overview of what this change does. This section helps readers quickly understand the scope before diving into findings.}

- **What changed:** {1-2 sentences describing the functional change}
- **Key files:** {list the 3-5 most important files changed, with one-line descriptions}
- **Patterns observed:** {e.g., "New API endpoints added", "Refactor of auth module", "Database migration + model update"}

---

## Executive Summary

{2-3 sentences: what was reviewed, key finding themes, overall assessment.
Example: "This PR adds JWT-based authentication to the API layer. The implementation is solid overall, but the token validation has a critical bypass path and the error handling in the auth middleware silently swallows connection failures. 3 findings require attention before merge."}

### Verdict

Determine the verdict using these criteria. Advisory-first tools sustain adoption while overly blocking tools get disabled within a month. AI approval should never count toward required review thresholds — the verdict signals priority to human reviewers, not a gate.

- **REQUEST CHANGES** — Any critical findings, OR high-severity security findings. These represent bugs or vulnerabilities that would cause real harm in production. Reserve this verdict for issues a senior engineer would block a merge over.
- **APPROVE WITH SUGGESTIONS** — High or medium findings exist, but none are critical or security-blocking. The code is functional but has significant improvement opportunities that the author should address.
- **APPROVE** — Only low-severity findings or no findings. The code is ready to merge.

{One of: APPROVE | APPROVE WITH SUGGESTIONS | REQUEST CHANGES}

**Blocking issues:** {N} (critical + high-security — these trigger REQUEST CHANGES)
**Action items:** {N} (high + medium — should be addressed but not merge-blocking)
**Suggestions:** {N} (low)

## 🔴 Critical Issues

{These MUST be fixed before merge. Include only findings with severity=critical and confidence>=80.}

### {finding.id}: {finding.title}

**File:** `{finding.file}:{finding.line_start}` | [permalink](https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/blob/{full_sha}/{finding.file}#L{line_start-1}-L{line_end+1})
**Dimension:** {finding.dimension} | **Confidence:** {finding.confidence}%
**Flagged by:** {list of agents that found this}

{finding.description}

**Evidence:**
```
{finding.evidence — the actual code snippet or behavior demonstrating the issue}
```

**Suggested fix:**
{finding.suggestion}

---

## 🟠 High-Priority Issues

{Should be fixed. Same format as Critical, but with severity=high.}

---

## 🟡 Medium Issues

{Worth addressing. Briefer format:}

| # | File | Issue | Dimension | Confidence |
|---|------|-------|-----------|------------|
| {id} | [`{file}:{line}`](https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/blob/{full_sha}/{file}#L{line-1}-L{line+1}) | {title} | {dimension} | {confidence}% |

{For each, a brief 1-2 sentence description below the table, or expand inline if the issue is nuanced.}

---

## 💡 Low-Priority Suggestions

{Nice to have. Bullet list format:}

- **{id}**: [`{file}:{line}`](https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/blob/{full_sha}/{file}#L{line-1}-L{line+1}) — {title} ({dimension}, {confidence}%)

---

## Surfaced Findings

{Pre-existing issues surfaced by this PR's changes. These were not introduced by this PR
but interact with it. Consider addressing them, but they are not blocking.
Severity has been downgraded one level from the original classification (see Phase 4a).}

| # | File | Issue | Dimension | Confidence | Originally from |
|---|------|-------|-----------|------------|-----------------|
| {id} | `{file}:{line}` | {title} | {dimension} | {confidence}% | {blame info — author, date} |

## Positive Observations

{What the code does well. This section matters — it signals what patterns to keep and provides balanced feedback. 3-5 bullet points.}

- {Positive observation with specific example}

## Review Dimensions Summary

{Brief per-dimension summary showing what each agent found or confirmed was clean.}

| Dimension | Agent | Findings | Notes |
|-----------|-------|----------|-------|
| Correctness & Error Handling | bug-detector | {N issues} | {summary or "Clean"} |
| Security | security-reviewer | {N issues} | {summary} |
| Cross-file Impact | cross-file-impact-analyzer | {N issues} | {summary} |
| Test Coverage | test-analyzer | {N issues} | {summary} |
| Conventions & Intent | conventions-and-intent | {N issues} | {summary} |

## Review Methodology

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Agents dispatched** | {list each agent with completion status: completed/failed/skipped} |
| **Model tier** | {mode: Optimized/Frontier — list which agents used which model} |
| **Findings pipeline** | {N raw findings → M after deterministic verification → K after confidence filter → J after dedup} |
| **Disagreement detection** | {N consensus (boosted), M singletons (passed through), K contradictions (routed to challenge), J suppressed} |
| **Blind challenge round** | {Triggered/Not triggered. If triggered: N findings blind-challenged, M downgraded, K boosted, J contested} |
| **Failed/skipped agents** | {list or "none"} |
| **Total review time** | {duration from Phase 1 to Phase 6} |
| **Prompt injection** | {N injection artifacts detected and discarded, or "none detected"} |

   {1-2 sentence description}

{If medium/low exist:}
<details>
<summary>{N} additional suggestions</summary>
