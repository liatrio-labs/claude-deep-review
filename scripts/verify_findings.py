    }

    Each finding in "verified" has an added "origin" field:
        "new"       — line was written in the current PR/branch diff
        "surfaced"  — line predates the current diff (pre-existing issue exposed by change)

    Each finding in "eliminated" has an added "elimination_reason" field explaining
    why it was removed (e.g., "line not in diff", "evidence mismatch", etc.).

No external Python dependencies — stdlib only.

    """
    Validate whether the finding's reported line range overlaps with the diff.

    Uses valid_lines set from parse_diff_lines().  Checks each line in
    [line_start, line_end] for presence in the diff.

    Per V4-10: findings entirely outside the diff are NOT eliminated — they
    are tagged as "surfaced" (cross-file context, pre-existing code exposed by
    the change).  This catches the calcom-PR10600 pattern where a finding
    targeted a line far outside the actual diff.

    Side effects:
    - If no diff line in [line_start, line_end] is present in valid_lines,
      sets finding["origin"] = "surfaced" and
      finding["diff_validation"] = {"in_diff": False, "reason": "..."}.
    - If at least one line overlaps, sets

    - If diff validation is skipped (valid_lines is None), sets
      finding["diff_validation"] = {"in_diff": None, "reason": "skipped"}.
