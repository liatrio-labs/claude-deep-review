validate_ndjson.py — Validate that a findings file is well-formed NDJSON.

Each non-empty line must parse as a complete JSON object on its own.
Reports any lines that fail to parse, with line numbers, the JSON parser's
error message, and a truncated snippet of the offending content.

Exit codes:
    0 — every non-empty line parses (or the file is missing / empty)
    1 — at least one line is invalid
    2 — usage error

Why this script exists
----------------------
Phase 3 review agents emit findings via ``printf '%s\\n' '<json>'`` because
``python3 -c`` and other dynamic-quoting forms are silently denied by the
subagent sandbox AST parser. That puts the burden of escaping ``\\n``,
``\\r``, ``\\t``, apostrophes, etc. on the agent. When an agent embeds a
raw newline (or other control character) inside a JSON string value, the
single ``printf`` call writes two physical lines and the merge pipeline
sees two malformed records instead of one valid finding.

Agents run this script as their final action so the bug is caught while
the agent is still in scope and can re-emit the bad finding(s) — instead
of leaving the orchestrator to scrape findings out of the agent's text
return as a fallback.

Usage:
    python3 validate_ndjson.py <findings_file>
