# CLAUDE.md — claude-deep-review

## Scripts

- **stdlib-only Python.** No pip dependencies. All scripts must use only the Python standard library.
- **Language-agnostic.** Scripts must not assume any particular programming language in the reviewed codebase. No `--include=*.py` or similar language filters — use `--exclude-dir` for non-source directories instead.
- **Repo root for searches.** `verify_findings.py` resolves the repo root at startup via `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`. All grep invocations use this absolute path, not `"."`.

## Findings schema

All pipeline stages use the **canonical agent schema**. These field names are non-negotiable:

- `description` (not `body`)
- `line_start` / `line_end` (not `line`)
- `origin` (not `blame_tag`)
- `dimension` — short name from agent output: `"bug"`, `"security"`, `"cross_file_impact"`, `"test_coverage"`, `"convention"`, `"intent"`, `"comment_accuracy"`, `"type_design"`, `"simplification"`. Never the agent name.
- `agent` — injected by the orchestrator during merge: `"bug-detector"`, `"security-reviewer"`, etc. Agents do not emit this field themselves.
- `cross_file_refs` — preserve from agent output. Used by `verify_findings.py` for automatic "surfaced" classification.

## Agents

- **Frontmatter is system-enforced.** `tools`, `effort`, `model`, `color` in agent YAML frontmatter are not advisory — Claude Code enforces them.
- **LSP-first investigation.** Agents prefer LSP (`goToDefinition`, `findReferences`, `hover`) with Grep fallback. This is documented in each agent's "How to investigate" section.
- **False-positive exclusion list is intentionally duplicated** across all 7 discovery agents. Do not refactor into a shared read — we want the guarantee that every agent has the list even if a file read fails. Each copy has a `<!-- Canonical source: references/false-positive-exclusions.md -->` comment pointing to the source of truth.

## Plugin structure

Scripts and agents live at the plugin root, not under `skills/deep-review/`:

```
claude-deep-review/          <- plugin root ({plugin_root})
├── agents/
├── hooks/                    <- PreToolUse hook config (Bash restriction for subagents)
├── scripts/
├── tests/
└── skills/
    └── deep-review/          <- skill base directory
```

SKILL.md derives `{plugin_root}` as two levels above the skill base directory. All script invocations use `{plugin_root}/scripts/`.

## Tests

- pytest with `unittest.TestCase` style. Run: `python -m pytest tests/ -q`
- 484 tests covering all pipeline scripts: `verify_findings.py`, `filter_findings.py`, `post_review.py`, `merge_findings.py`, `apply_validations.py`, `apply_challenges.py`, `validate_bash_subagent.py`.

## Temp file convention

- `{tmpdir}` in SKILL.md and references is a **resolved literal path** from `echo ${TMPDIR:-/tmp}` (Phase 1). Agents receive the resolved path in their dispatch prompt via `Findings file:`; they never use `$TMPDIR` in Bash commands. This avoids sandbox permission prompts on every write.
- The PreToolUse hook accepts both `$TMPDIR` and literal temp-directory paths (`/tmp/`, `/private/tmp/`, `/var/folders/`) for resilience against agent behavioral drift.

## Writing pipeline JSON

Use the `python3 -c "import json; ..."` pattern to write JSON to disk for scripts. Never use the Write tool (requires prior Read on target) or Bash heredocs (zsh corrupts `!` as `\!`).
